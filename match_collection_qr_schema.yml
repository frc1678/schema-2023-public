# Used for Match Collection QR compression by Match Collection App and QR decompression by Server
# QR is encoded in an Alphanumeric QR

# Contains information about this schema file
schema_file:
  # Version of schema file
  # Incremented every merged schema change
  version: 6

# Each decompressed variable name corresponds to a length 2 or 3 list
# First item is the compressed variable name
# Second item is server-side data type
# Third item (if it exists) is the type within the list
# Names starting with "_" do not correspond to a compressed variable, they are used to aid in (de)compression

# Data that is shared between the objective and subjective QRs.

# Timeline is part of objective match collection QR
# Data for an action in the timeline

timeline:
  # No separators within timeline to reduce QR size. Each action is a fixed 5-character length
